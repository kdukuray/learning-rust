Allowed Instructions

ADD REGISTER REGISTER
SUB REGISTER REGISTER
MUL REGISTER REGISTER
DIV REGISTER REGISTER

IF REGISTER VAL
JUMP LINE_NUMBER
PRINT REGISTER


To do list
1. Have the output state of the registers be written to a file
2. Implement a simple test script that people can use to test the language (something like
an implementation of a fibonacci function)
3. Improve documentation
4. Add more error handling
5. Read in file name from system arguments
6. Make the error messages better by printing the correct line that contains the error

Maybe
1. Add functionality for users to be able to enter the number of registers they would like
2. Add the ability for users to define functions


Side notes
1. Remember that the for each instruction line, there may be other tokens on the same line
but based on the Mnemonics in the instruction, the interpreter will only read the relative ones
and discard the rest.
